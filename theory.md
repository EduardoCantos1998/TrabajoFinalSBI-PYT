# Theory
Proteinâ€“protein interactions (PPIs) are central to biological systems; and predicting the interacting residues is useful for constructing PPI networks, analysing mutations, drug design, drug discovery and improve annotation of protein funciton. But 3-dimension structures and their interactions is not short of complexity issues that could not be evaluated before. larger datasets and GPU acceleration have enabled the training of deeper neural network architectures.

Broadly there are 3 categories for PPI site prediction: 
- PP docking methods: seek to reproduce structures on the resulting protein complex;
- Structure-based methods
- Sequence-based methods:

There are a number of actively developed machine learning frame- works. A popular choice for traditional ML is SciKit-Learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). For deep learning frameworks, popular choices include: PyTorch (https://pytorch.org), TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org), and Theano (http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/).
