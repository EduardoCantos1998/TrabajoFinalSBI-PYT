## Introduction
This project is designed to determine the binding site of protein using Random Forest (RF).
The program takes a PDB file and generates an output called output.pdb that has information that can be visualized in [Jmol](https://jmol.sourceforge.net/), [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/), [UCSF Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/index.html), etc.
To extract secundary structure information we used [#references](DSSP).

## Training
We will use the subset of the scPDB dataset generated by the PUResNET team. We will also use the BindingDB as a simple visual validation set. 
We extracted the PDB files from the datasets with only PDBs included in articles, the subset of files drawn from the ChEMBL, and also the subset of the files from patents. And more…

## Requirements
This is an Python script that particularly uses the following dependencies to take into account: biopython, df_maker==0.1
freesasa==2.0.3
mol2==0.1.6
numpy,
pandas, scikit-learn, dssp.

## Command line Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EduardoCantos1998/TrabajoFinalSBI-PYT
cd TrabajoFinalSBI-PYT
```

and proceed to create a python env to run the scripts.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv # Or name it as desired 
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
cd Code
```
## Usage 
This is the workflow for the general use of the tool:

```mermaid
graph  LR
subgraph OPTIONALLY: creating your own pickle fa:fa-jar with your own data;
  subgraph invoked;
    direction LR;
    B[model.py]; 
    C[mol2.py]-.-o B;
    D[df_maker.py]-.-o B;
    E[dictionary_pickler.py]-.-o B;
  end
end
G(((custom data))) --> B;
invoked -.-o B
  A(((input.pdb))) --> F;
subgraph testing pdb with our data;
  B -- model.pckl -.-o F[pdb_testing.py];
end;
F ==> Z(((output.pdb)))
```
It takes as an input a PDB file which is evaluated using... then; the output will be a list of the aminoacids and sites belonging to a binding site. 

This is an example of the output:

```
binding_site_prediction = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
amino_acids = ['A', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N']

# Obtener los aminoácidos que corresponden con el binding site
binding_site_amino_acids = [amino_acids[i] for i, val in enumerate(binding_site_prediction) if val == 1]

print(binding_site_amino_acids)
# Output: ['D', 'E', 'G', 'H', 'M', 'N']
```

Starting with `Code/mol.py`, The `get_protein`, `get_proteinCA`, and `get_proteinCB` methods extract the coordinates of all atoms, alpha-carbons (CA), and beta-carbons (CB), `get_cavity`, `get_site`, `get_siteCA`, `get_siteCB` in binding cavity, binding site, and ligand of the protein from the PDB file, and return them as NumPy matrices.

Finally`pdb_testing.py` takes the `model.pkl` and does a prediction based.

Invoked scripts:
- `mol2pdb.py`, which downloads PDB (Protein Data Bank) and FASTA files for a list of protein codes, which are present in the `"final_data/"` directory.
- `df_maker`

### Creating your own pickle :green_book:
To extend the usability of the tools provided here we also give instructions on how to use the scripts to create a custom pickle to run Random Forest on your own data.

#### Adding the PDB

### Trained Data
Training a model for protein-ligand binding prediction requires a large and diverse dataset that represents a wide range of protein-ligand interactions. In this project, we will be using the subset of the scPDB dataset generated by the PUResNET team as our primary training dataset.
